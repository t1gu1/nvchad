### Install Pre-requisites

- `git clone https://github.com/t1gu1/nvchad ~/.config/nvim && nvim`
- [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) as your terminal font. Make sure the nerd font you set doesn't end with Mono to prevent small icons. Example : JetbrainsMono Nerd Font and not JetbrainsMono Nerd Font Mono
- Ripgrep is required for grep searching with Telescope (OPTIONAL).
- GCC, Windows users must have mingw installed and set on path.
- Make, Windows users must have GnuWin32 installed and set on path.
- When you open the first time, always check your setup with the `:checkhealth` command

### Nice little plugins added & ajustment (Cause not mentionned later in this doc)

First there is an ajustement to not replace the yank by using `d`, `c`, `p` so you can copy and paste without the fear of replacing the yarnked buffer.

- `rainbow-delimiters`  | Make a rainbow with () {} [] - Easier to see the bloc
- `mini.cursorword`     | Underline all words similar to the one under the cursor
- `mini.surround`       | Sourround content with () {} [] "" ''
- `mini.move`           | Move line or selection
- `lspsaga`             | Nice Lsp action, debug, etc bubble
- `project.nvim`        | Added to NvDash quick find project
- `lazygit.nvim`        | An incredible way to have a git visual inside nvim

## Terminal is simple and keep the theme hilights (NvChad.term)

## Nice way to access the terminal (Custom NvChad.term mapping)

### Simply use these shorcuts:

- `<leader>t` Open the last opened terminal (Create one if none created)
- `1<leader>t` Open the second terminal (Create one if none created)
- `2<leader>t` Open the second terminal (Create one if none created)
- `3<leader>t` Open the second terminal (Create one if none created)
- `4<leader>t` Open the second terminal (Create one if none created)
- `5<leader>t` Open the second terminal (Create one if none created)
- You get it. It works from `1` to `9`.

### An other way to switch or simply view opened terminal

Shortcut: Simply `t`

## Nice nvim-tree & UI (Customised)

It's nice to know that it will auto close if you'll go out of focus or select a file.

## A Noice popup/box for searching and commands

This is what appear when you press `:` or `/`.
It remove that space at the bottom of the screen for that visual with nice context icons.
